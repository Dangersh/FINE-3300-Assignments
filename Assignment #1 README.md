# The Task: This project marked our first assignment in the FINE 3300 - Python for Finance Professionals course. The objective was to develop a Python program that calculates various periodic mortgage payments (e.g., monthly, bi-weekly) based on user inputs. Furthermore, we were tasked with setting up GitHub repositories and uploading our project, in order to familiarize ourselves with the platform and submit our work.

# Purpose of the Task: The primary goal was to understand how to work with Python by leveraging our finance backgrounds to calculate periodic payments for Canadian mortgages. This included: 1. Writing a Python function to handle user inputs and perform the calculations for different payment frequencies. 2. Ensuring the program adhered to semi-annual compounding. 3. Formatting the output for easy readability and accurate rounding. 4. Uploading the completed code to GitHub.

# My Thought Process: 1. Breaking Down the Problem, I identified the inputs: principal amount, quoted interest rate, and amortization period. I determined the six payment frequencies to calculate and how they are related to the monthly payment. 2. Planning the Code, I outlined a single function, mortgage_payments, that would take the inputs and return all the payment types. 3. I tested the program using sample inputs, including the example provided in the assignment (e.g., $500,000 principal, 5.5% rate, 25 years) and verified the results based on those figures.  

# Conclusion: Overall, I found this project to be a really valuable learning experience. It was my first time applying Python to a real-world finance problem, and breaking it down into manageable parts, from coding to testing, really helped me understand the process. I also got some practical experience with tools like GitHub and VS Code, which I know will be useful in future projects. Overall, this assignment which served as an introduction to Python programming, helped me build confidence in writing code, and seeing how automation can simplify financial calculations.
