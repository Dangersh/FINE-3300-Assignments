# This project was our first assignment in the Fine 3300 Python for Finance Professionals class. The assignment required writing a program to calculate various types of mortgage payments, including monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, and others, based on user input. In addition, it required uploading the project to GitHub.

# Purpose of the Task: The primary goal was to understand how to work with Python by leveraging our finance backgrounds to calculate periodic payments for Canadian mortgages. This included: 1. Writing a Python function to handle user inputs and perform the calculations for different payment frequencies. 2. Ensuring the program adhered to semi-annual compounding. 3. Formatting the output for easy readability and accurate rounding. 4. Uploading the completed code to GitHub.

# My Thought Process: 1. Breaking Down the Problem, I identified the inputs: principal amount, quoted interest rate, and amortization period. I determined the six payment frequencies to calculate and how they are related to the monthly payment. 2. Planning the Code, I outlined a single function, mortgage_payments, that would take the inputs and return all the payment types. 3. I tested the program using sample inputs, including the example provided in the assignment (e.g., $500,000 principal, 5.5% rate, 25 years) and verified the results based on those figures.  

# Conclusion: This project was a great way to dive into Python Coding. It showed me how to leverage GitHub, VS Code, and using Python in finance settings.
